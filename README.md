A note to the lua files:
IceSL can't export the stl file directly as of version 1.0.5, you'll have to export it into different parts and then merge them (e.g. with MeshMixer). The parts are scaled down to 0.5, you'll have to resize them by factor 2. The logos (helloween.stl and helloween_mirror.stl) aren't included, you can replace them with your own texts or skip them altogether (They have been created from a black/white image loaded to Cura and converted to a height map).
